				<h2>As a Programmer</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a computer programmer by trade, and often by hobby as well.
					I hope this site can act as a resource for people looking to build web-based applications, and possibly personal game projects in the future; and of course, I always appreciate feedback!
					If you have questions, thoughts, or advice about anything you see me doing here on my site, feel free to post a comment over on my blog!
				</p>
				
				<h2>As a Gamer</h2>
				<p>
					I still actively play <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/">Eve Online</a>.
					Besides being obsessed with the <a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Ishkur">Ishkur</a> - an assault-frigate class ship - my main character in New Eden also tends to be an explorer.
					While I normally play solo, I'd be interested in teaming up for almost any activity that allows me to, well, fly my Ishkurs!!
					Send along a private message in-game to Shaoylaenn Campbell, or stop by the Center for Advanced Studies corp chat (yes, I'm still in my n00b corp)!
				</p>
				
				<h2>As an Animated Filmmaker</h2>
				<p>
					You can follow the restoration of my old animated films over on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHvoItS_0Nmueb0IuZoLSKg">Riley Entertainment Youtube Channel</a>!
					Any feedback or comments on my silly little films is always appreciated.
					You can expect to see more than just my old films there, as I've also posted a number of guides and playthroughs during my time with Eve Online.

				<h2>As a Programmer</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a computer programmer by trade, and often by hobby as well.
					I hope this site can act as a resource for people looking to build web-based applications; and of course, I always appreciate feedback!
					If you have questions, thoughts, or advice about anything you see me doing here on my site, feel free to post a comment over on my blog!
				</p>
				<p>
					I also have full source code for this website available over on my <a href="https://github.com/ryantherileyman">GitHub</a> account!
				</p>
				
				<h2>As a Gamer</h2>
				<p>
					I'm becoming more and more active in <a href="https://www.elitedangerous.com/">Elite: Dangerous</a>, an open-world space game that simulates the entire Milky Way - quite literally, 400 billion star systems!
					My activities tend to be geared towards exploring, with some combat on the side.
					I plan on blogging about my experiences in the game, and maybe producing some fun videos as I go.
					You can find me over on the <a href="https://forums.frontier.co.uk/forum.php">Frontier discussion forums</a>, posting as <span class="game-character-name">riley75</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Continuing with the space simulation theme, I also still play <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/">Eve Online</a>.
					Besides being obsessed with the <a href="https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Ishkur">Ishkur</a> - an assault-frigate class ship - my main character in New Eden also tends to be an explorer.
					While I normally play solo, I'd be interested in teaming up for almost any activity that allows me to, well, fly my Ishkurs!!
					Send along a private message in-game to Shaoylaenn Campbell, or stop by the Center for Advanced Studies corp chat (yes, I'm still in my n00b corp)!
				</p>
				
				<h2>As an Animated Filmmaker</h2>
				<p>
					You can follow the restoration of my old animated films over on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHvoItS_0Nmueb0IuZoLSKg">Riley Entertainment Youtube Channel</a>!
					Any feedback or comments on my silly little films is always appreciated.
					You can expect to see more than just my old films there in the future, as I'm slowly but surely working on new content.

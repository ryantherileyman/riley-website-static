		System is <b>Herculis Sector GR-W C1-13</b>.
		I was not the first discoverer in this system.
		I performed a detailed surface scan of the star, all planets, all moons, and even all belt clusters.
		The system view shows all 11 planets, and all its moons.
		However, one moon did not have a First Discovered By indicator.
		Additionally, only 10 of the 40 or so celestial objects are showing as available to sell.
